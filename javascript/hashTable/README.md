# Hashtables
In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an
associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code,
 into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Challenge
Implementing a Hashtable  with LinkedList

## Approach & Efficiency
* Time complexty Big O => O(1).

* Space complexty  Big O => O(n).

## API

* set
   * Arguments: key, value
  * Returns: nothing

* get
  * Arguments: key
  * Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
* contains
   * Arguments: key
   * Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
*  keys
   * Returns: Collection of keys
hash
   * Arguments: key
   * Returns: Index in the collection for that key
