# Fizz_Buzz_Tree

### Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

### Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Feature Tasks
* Write a function called fizz buzz tree
* Arguments: k-ary tree
* Return: new k-ary tree
### Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

* If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
* If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
* If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
* If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
